CTMI - short for Craftable Travelling Merchant Items. 
All that this Mod does is it simply adds recipes for the difficult to obtain Travelling Merchant items which can be so infuriating to get.

Feedback:
If you have any ideas on how I could improve the recipes/any suggestions for Mods that I could make the Mod compatible with, if you can, please reply to the forum post, as I'd like to improve the mod in any way I can.

Mod support:
Currently, the Mod accounts for Calamity's recipes and items for the Travelling Merchant.

So, apparently, I'm a dumbass and the mods already do what I've *mostly been doing, which is adding their materials to the recipe groups that are Vanilla (such as the wood recipe group), 
however they do that on their own.
